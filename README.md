# MinersVIPDoge 

(Development Code Name, please recommend names on the Discord channel https://discord.com/channels/875141035313995826/875201872280031234)

Sample front-running names: **EtherMine**, **NFTMine**


## Abstract Idea

Have a "virtual blockchain" mining economy using NFTs that you can mine using proof-of-work.


## Key Concepts

1. On your browser, be able to proof-of-work (POW) mine to get an NFT (theoretically, in the future the mining could be done with a specialized machine like a Bitcoin or Dogecoin miner)
2. Collect rewards for owning that NFT
3. The mining algorithm needs to increase in difficulty with time, and also the amount to mine needs to increase with time
4. Need a way to convert the original MinersVIP NFTs to these new ones (possibly can do a batch process script)

These need to be done on the blockchain. The parameters in terms of the numbers and rewards need to be figured out.


### Development Process 


Ultimately, what is needed:

1. a webpage to do the mining (and assume hosting along with that)
2. smart contracts to handle the minting and rewards
3. a process to test the smart contracts
4. a process to deploy the smart contracts

These should to be done in a standardized and systematic way to ensure quality and most importantly security.

## Brief Backstory - A Fork of the MinersVIP NFT Project

MinersVIP is an NFT project where you use your browser to mine NFT rocks or gems. The idea was very good, the implementation and management was essentially giving people negative feelings and they didn't like it because they invested in it and felt like it was potentially a rug-pull. If not a rug-pull, the community was not happy with how the project was being maintained, and there is no reason for that given the already-substantial Ether investments from NFT minters and traders.

This is a revitalization of this concept, it will survive and thrive this time because we have a strong community that is open to implementing this system in a responsible and ethical manner. The idea behind this is very smart, it needs to be implemented correctly though using best practices.

### **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**

One of the keys here is responsible management for the community, listening to the community and working with them. This is new, the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), although it seems to be the evolution and if managed correctly it is the next level above traditional technology companies. 


One of the things we need to learn from the original implementation is why we all liked it so much, and then also why we really didn’t like certain parts of it.

This is a technology of scale, and complexity is very, very costly at scale. We must keep this super simple, especially at first, in order to get this off the ground fast, and for it to be sustainable, and robust at scale.


The original MinersVIP had a simplicity to it that was highly appealing (and that would also be its fault in the long run). That and the fact that it was a decentralized technology that was not adhering to its members requests. This being a next level technology company, decentralized yes, although as an organization analogous to a technology company, customer service is still key. They aren’t really our customers, although they are analogous to being our customers, the people who mint, trade, and hold the NFTs. We are also our own "customers" in that sense because we have and use the NFTs ourselves.


**We will make sure the technology is maintained and supervised over time, and remains secure. Once it's built, we should aim for a point where it is complete as a technology and we no longer have to make any adjustments (aside from required fixes to maintain the intended functionality). That would be awesome!**

(at least have the "core" technology be complete at some point, others can work further and add more if they want)
