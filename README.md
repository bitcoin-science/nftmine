## Quick Backstory - A Fork of the MinersVIP NFT Project

MinersVIP is an NFT project where you use your browser to mine NFT rocks or gems. The idea was very good, the implementation and management was essentially giving people negative feelings and they didn't like it because they invested in it and felt like it was potentially a rug-pull.

This is a revitalization of this concept, it will survive and thrive this time because we have a strong community that is open to implementing this system in a responsible and ethical manner. The idea behind this is very smart, it needs to be implemented correctly though using best practices.

One of the keys here is responsible management for the community, listening to the community and working with them. This is new, the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), although it seems to be the evolution and if managed correctly it is the next level above traditional technology companies. 

...

One of the things we need to learn from the original implementation is why we all liked it so much, and then also why we really didn’t like certain parts of it.

This is a technology of scale, and complexity is very, very costly at scale. We must keep this super simple, especially at first, in order to get this off the ground fast, and for it to be sustainable, and robust at scale.


The original MinersVIP had a simplicity to it that was highly appealing, and that was also its fault. That and the fact that it was a decentralized technology that was not adhering to its members requests. This is  being a next level technology company decentralized yes, customer service is key. They aren’t really our customers, although they are analogous to our customers, the people who mint, trade, and hold the NFTs.
